# 🚀 FL-Base

**A solid and reusable REST API template built with Ktor and Exposed**  

FL-Base is a foundational template for quickly bootstrapping REST APIs and backend servers. Since I frequently use this structure, I've centralized it here to streamline access to dependencies, architecture, and best practices.  

🔹 **Tech stack:**  
- [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor) – Fast and lightweight Kotlin web framework  
- [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) – SQL ORM framework for Kotlin
